The Python code uses the following extra modules:<br>
pymysql for mysql databases<br>
openpyxl for excel export<br>
bcrypt to hash passwords<br>
You can test this program with a supplied test database (testDatabase.db). It is filled with a few fictional workers and some real shifts.<br>
For this you have to uncomment line 20 (self.dbModule = 'sqlite3' #local database) and comment line 21 (self.dbModule = 'pymysql' #sql server) out.<br>
