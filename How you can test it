Server
The Python code uses the following extra modules:
- pymysql for mysql databases
- openpyxl for excel export
- bcrypt to hash passwords
You can test this program with a supplied test database (testDatabase.db). It is filled with a few fictional workers and some real shifts.
For this you have to uncomment line 20 (self.dbModule = 'sqlite3' #local database) and comment line 21 (self.dbModule = 'pymysql' #sql server) out.
