Server
The Python code uses the following extra modules:
- pymysql for mysql databases
- openpyxl for excel export
- bcrypt to hash passwords
You can test this program with a supplied test database (testDatabase.db). Normally it should use a MySQL database on a web server. The test database is filled with a few fictional workers. For testing the client program you should save passwords (Ashok Kumar's password is "cicu"). There are also some real shifts and worker requests for year 2022 week 15.
To use this database you have to uncomment line 20 (self.dbModule = 'sqlite3' #local database) and comment line 21 (self.dbModule = 'pymysql' #sql server) out.

Client
As far as I know, you have to set up a webserver and you have to use some MySQL managing software.
How I used it:
With WampServer I set up a web server and I recreated the structure of testDatabase.db with the samen name in phpMyAdmin (the server and the client programs both use the hard coded name testDatabase.db). Then in a browser I can connect to SH-Schedule-manager.php throught the address localhost/.../SH-Schedule-manager.php
You have to select a name from the dropdown menu, then select some shifts, then give the correct passwort (Ashok Kumar's password is "cicu") and click "Ráérés leadása". If everything goes well, there will be a popup message about success. You can check this by selecting the name again.
